# *CDM Model: Legal Agreement namespace classification*

_What is being released_

This refactor is the fourth incremental change that will further transform the org.isda.cdm file into a hierarchical namespace tree.

This fourth refactor includes the changes for the __cdm.legalagreement.*__ set of namespaces.

The namespaces contain components used across the CDM for 
* Generic documentation concepts: legal agreement, contract, calc agent, disruption and extraordinary events,
* Common legal agreement concepts,
* Contract (i.e. transaction confirmation) concepts, 
* Credit support concepts: CSA, collateral, elections, initial margin, threshold, minimum transfer amount,
* and Master agreement concepts.

_Review Direction_

In Rosetta Core (https://ui.rosetta-technology.io/), review the File or Namespace structure in the Editor Textual View. In the CDM Portal, 
navigate to the Downloads tile, then download artefacts in Java, DAML, Typescript or Scala distribution format and review the source to see the new cdm.legalagreement.* files.

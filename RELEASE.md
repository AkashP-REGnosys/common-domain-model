# *CDM Model: Observable namespace classification*

_What is being released_

This refactor is the second incremental changes that will further transform the org.isda.cdm file into a hierarchical namespace tree. 

This second refactor includes the changes for the __cdm.observable.*__ package.

This package contain components used across the CDM for market data, holiday calendar date, event (extraordinary event, trigger event, disruption event) & asset (schedule, settlement, price and quantity notation etc).

_Review Directions_

In the CDM Portal, navigate to the Downloads tile, review the generated Java source to see the new cdm.observable.* package.

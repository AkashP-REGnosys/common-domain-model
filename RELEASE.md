# *Bugfix. Product Qualification Example*

_What is being released_

* Bugfix. Fixed the Qualification Java example to make use of the latest CDM Java APIs and additionally indicates where the qualification values should be stored on the CDM object. Added automated tests for several examples to catch code-level failures prior to releases. 

_Review Directions_

In the CDM Portal, in the Downloads section, download the CDM Java examples pack and inspect Qualification.java.

# *Product Model - Commodity Mapping*

_What is being released?_

The recent price and quantity schedule refactoring highlighted some gaps in the coverage of the FpML commodity test pack and therefore in the mappings provided.

This release provides 2 additional variants: a commodity swaption and a commodity swap with a custom schedule, with their corresponding mappings.

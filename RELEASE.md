# *Legal Agreement Model â€“ Removal of SCSA from Legal Agreement Name enumeration list*

_What is being released?_

Removal of legal agreement type Standard Credit Support Annex from the list of identifiable document names in the `LegalAgreementNameEnum` list. The reason for this being, the document is no longer widely negotiated and research has indicated less than 5 of these exist operationally. Having it referenced in CDM has confused members and feedback has confirmed consensus agreement to remove from the model.

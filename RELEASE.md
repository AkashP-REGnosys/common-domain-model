# *CDM to FpML Projection*

_What is being released_

Infrastructure work to support the projection from CDM into FpML 5.10 documents.  Initial projection service implementation and  mapping classes support the projection of products that qualify as `InterestRate_IRSwap_FixedFloat`.

_Review direction_

The projection functionality will be made available in Rosetta Core, where users can drag and drop CDM JSON files in, which will be projected into FpML 5.10 and displayed as XML.

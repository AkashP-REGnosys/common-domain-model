# *CDM to FpML Projection*

_What is being released_

Further infrastructure work to support the projection from CDM into FpML 5.10 documents:
- Add validation to the input CDM JSON before running projection to XML, so all relevent diagnostics can be displayed to the user.

_Review direction_

The projection functionality will be made available in Rosetta Core, where users can drag and drop CDM JSON files in, which will be projected into FpML 5.10 and displayed as XML.

Users of the distribution are encouraged to start with the CDM documentation, found in documentation/common-domain-modal/index.html to understand the organisation of the model and its components.

The ISDA Digital CDM distribution is organised into the folders below.

lib
All library files required to use the CDM, to create CDM objects in Java and to execute the calculation logic.

common-domain-model
The set of files that describe the Common Domain Model.  To open a .rosetta file, simple choose the text editor of choice.  New starters should begin with the Contract and Event classes, which can be found in model_cdm_product.rosetta and model_cdm_event.rosetta respectively.

documentation
Contains both the Java and CDM documentation in html format.  In each on the sub-folders you will find an index.html file.  Open this file to inspect the documents.  Note that you extract the .zip archive before your browser can assess all the files.

src
The source code for generated Java artifacts.
